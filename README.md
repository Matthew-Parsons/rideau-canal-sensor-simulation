# Overview
Simulates the three sensors on the rideau canal, and sends that information to the IoT hub

## Technologies used
Python, Azure IoT SDK

# Prerequisites
latest version of python, azure.iot.device library, dotenv library

# Installation
clone the repo from github

# Configuration
create a .env file with values for the connection strings shown in .env.example

# Usage
1. open the rideau-canal-sensor-simulation repo in vscode and create a virtual python environment, then open a terminal in said environment
2. run sensor-simulator.py

# Code Structure
get_telemetry(location): generates telemetry data for a location specified via input

main(location, connection_string): connects to an IoT device via the connection string and sends the data generated by get_telemetry to said IoT device

if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": runs each of the three sensor scripts as their own process via threading
